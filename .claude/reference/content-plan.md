# Fractional Quest Content Creation Plan

## Phase Overview

This plan outlines a systematic content enrichment strategy based on GSC data analysis and Tavily competitive research conducted in January 2026.

## Research Methodology

1. **GSC Data Analysis**: Identify high-impression, low-click keywords (opportunity gaps)
2. **Tavily Research**: Get AI Overview responses, competitor content, pricing data
3. **Content Gap Analysis**: Map what competitors have vs what we're missing
4. **FAQ Pattern Extraction**: Identify People Also Ask style questions

## Priority 1: High-Impression Zero-Click Keywords

These keywords have significant search volume but we're not capturing clicks:

| Keyword | Impressions | Position | Action |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| fractional cmo | 118 | 75 | Enrich /fractional-cmo page |
| fractional cmo uk | 115 | 35 | Add UK-specific section |
| interim cmo | 97 | 51 | Enrich /interim-cmo page |
| hire fractional coos | 71 | 28 | Enrich /hire-fractional-coo |
| part time cmo | 69 | 26 | Create /part-time-cmo page |
| interim finance director | 58 | 50 | Create dedicated page |
| fractional fd | 52 | 70 | Enrich /fractional-fd page |
| interim cfo | 51 | 72 | Enrich /interim-cfo page |
| part time cfo | 45 | 57 | Enrich /part-time-cfo page |

## Priority 2: Comparison Content (Major Gap)

Competitors like Communications Edge, VCMO, and McCracken Alliance have dedicated comparison content. We need:

### Comparison Tables to Create

1. **Fractional vs Interim vs Full-Time**
   - Target pages: All role pages (CMO, CFO, CTO, COO, etc.)
   - Format: Feature comparison table
   - Include: Commitment, Duration, Cost, Focus, Flexibility, Best For

2. **Role-Specific Comparisons**
   - Fractional CMO vs Marketing Agency
   - Fractional CFO vs Accountant
   - Fractional CTO vs Tech Consultant
   - Interim CFO vs Fractional CFO

3. **Cost Comparison Tables**
   - Full-time total cost (salary + NI + pension + benefits + recruitment)
   - Fractional cost (day rate x days x weeks)
   - Savings calculation

### Template Structure
```
| Feature | Fractional | Interim | Full-Time |
|---------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Commitment | 1-3 days/week | Full-time (temp) | Full-time (perm) |
| Duration | Ongoing (6+ months) | 3-12 months | Permanent |
| Cost | £3,000-£6,000/month | £8,000-£12,000/week | £150k-£250k/year + benefits |
| Focus | Strategic + operational | Gap-fill or transformation | All responsibilities |
| Flexibility | Scale up/down | Fixed term | Limited |
| Best For | Growing companies | Leadership gaps | Large orgs |
```

## Priority 4: Definition Boxes for AI Overview

Google AI Overview favors concise, clear definitions at the top of pages. Add definition boxes (60-80 words) that directly answer:

### Format
```
<DefinitionBox>
  <Title>What is a Fractional CMO?</Title>
  <Definition>
    A Fractional CMO is a part-time Chief Marketing Officer who provides
    strategic marketing leadership to companies 1-3 days per week. They
    typically charge £600-£1,500 per day in the UK, offering the same
    expertise as a full-time CMO at 30-50% of the cost. Ideal for growing
    companies that need senior marketing leadership without full-time
    commitment.
  </Definition>
</DefinitionBox>
```

### Pages Needing Definition Boxes
- [ ] /fractional-cmo
- [ ] /fractional-cfo
- [ ] /fractional-cto
- [ ] /fractional-coo
- [ ] /interim-cmo
- [ ] /interim-cfo
