# Fractional Quest - SEO Content Improvement Plan

**Generated:** February 2026
**Data Source:** Google Search Console (Queries.csv, Pages.csv)

---

## Executive Summary

Based on GSC data analysis, there are **significant ranking opportunities** across category pages and executive search keywords. The main issues are:

1. **Category pages (fractional CMO/CFO/CTO)** rank position 30-60 despite high impressions
2. **Executive search pages** have low visibility but high commercial intent
3. **Virtual/Part-time variants** are underperforming
4. **Good-position pages** have poor CTR (meta descriptions need work)

---

## Priority Tiers

### TIER 1: Executive Search Pages (User Priority)
*High commercial intent, specifically requested*

| Page | Impressions | Position | Action |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|

| `/ciso-executive-search` | 78 | 6.04 | **CTR optimization** - Good position, add rich snippets |
| `/interim-executive-search` | 45 | 46.22 | **Major rewrite** - High potential, poor ranking |
| `/executive-search-firms` | 10 | 64.8 | **Major rewrite** - Generic term, competitive |

### TIER 2: Category Definition Pages (Highest Impact)
*These have the most impressions but rank poorly*
