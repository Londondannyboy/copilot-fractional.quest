  { question: "What is interim executive search?", answer: "Interim executive search is a recruitment service for temporary C-suite and senior leadership positions. Interim executives work full-time for a defined period (typically 3-12 months) to cover gaps, lead transformations, or manage crises." },
  { question: "How much does interim executive search cost?", answer: "Interim executive search fees typically range from 15-25% of the total contract value. For a 6-month interim CFO at £1,500/day, expect placement fees of £15,000-£25,000." },
  { question: "How is interim different from fractional executive search?", answer: "Interim executives work full-time (5 days/week) for a fixed period. Fractional executives work part-time (1-3 days/week) ongoing. Use interim for urgent, full-focus needs; fractional for ongoing part-time leadership." },
  { question: "How long does interim executive search take?", answer: "Interim executive placements are typically faster than permanent search: 2-4 weeks for common roles (CFO, CTO). Agencies with established networks can often present candidates within days." },
  { question: "When should I hire an interim executive?", answer: "Hire interim executives for: (1) Sudden departures requiring immediate coverage, (2) Transformations requiring dedicated focus, (3) M&A integration periods, (4) Crisis management, (5) Bridge roles while recruiting permanently." },
  { question: "What day rates do interim executives charge?", answer: "Interim executive day rates vary by role: CFO £1,200-£1,800/day, CTO £1,000-£1,600/day, CMO £900-£1,400/day, CEO £1,500-£2,500/day. Rates depend on sector, company size, and complexity." },
