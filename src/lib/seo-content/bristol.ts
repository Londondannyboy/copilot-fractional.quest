      answer:
        "Bristol fractional executives typically command £700-£1,150 per day, around 15-25% below London rates. Tech-focused roles (CTOs, CPOs) are in particularly high demand due to the 'Silicon Gorge' ecosystem, often commanding rates closer to London levels.",

      question: "How does Bristol's tech scene affect fractional demand?",
      answer:
        "Bristol's thriving tech ecosystem (Graphcore, Ultraleap, Ovo Energy, etc.) creates strong demand for fractional CTOs and CPOs. Many London tech executives relocate for quality of life while maintaining fractional portfolios across both cities.",

      question: "What sectors drive fractional hiring in Bristol?",
      answer:
        "Aerospace leads (Airbus, Rolls-Royce supply chain), followed by fintech, creative industries, and deep tech. The Bristol & Bath corridor has particular strength in robotics, AI, and clean technology.",

    {
      question: "Can I combine Bristol with London clients?",

    },
    {
      question: "Are Bristol roles mostly hybrid?",
      answer:
        "Around 70% of Bristol fractional roles offer hybrid arrangements - higher than London. The city's compact size and excellent public transport make commuting easy, but companies are generally flexible about remote work.",
