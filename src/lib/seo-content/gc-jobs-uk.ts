    { question: "How much does a fractional General Counsel cost in the UK?", answer: "A fractional General Counsel in the UK typically costs £4,000-£8,000 per month or £1,000-£1,500 per day, depending on sector and complexity. According to LawyerLink and Taylor Root (Jan 2026): Scale-up/growth GCs charge £950-£1,300/day, tech/SaaS GCs charge £1,000-£1,400/day, PE-backed GCs charge £1,100-£1,500/day, and financial services (FCA-regulated) GCs command £1,200-£1,700/day. M&A specialists charge £1,200-£1,600/day. This represents 52-74% savings compared to a full-time GC hire (£150,000-£280,000 annually including benefits)." },
    { question: "What qualifications do fractional GCs need?", answer: "Most require qualification as a solicitor (SRA-regulated) or barrister with 10-15+ years PQE. In-house experience is highly valued, particularly in commercial contracts, M&A, and regulatory matters. Sector expertise (financial services, tech, life sciences) commands premium rates. Previous GC or senior legal counsel experience typically essential." },
    { question: "How much do fractional General Counsels earn?", answer: "UK fractional GCs typically earn £1,000-£1,500 per day, with financial services, M&A, and PE-backed roles at the premium end (£1,200-£1,700). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £200,000-£340,000 are achievable while offering portfolio variety." },
    { question: "What's the typical fractional GC engagement?", answer: "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 1-2 days per week commitment. Transaction support (M&A, fundraising) may be more intensive for defined periods. Many relationships become ongoing as companies value legal continuity. The subscription model is increasingly popular for predictable legal oversight." },
    { question: "Do fractional GCs work remotely?", answer: "About 60% of fractional GC roles offer hybrid arrangements. Legal work is increasingly remote-friendly for document review and advice, though some on-site presence is expected for board meetings, negotiations, and sensitive discussions. Financial services roles tend toward more on-site presence." },
