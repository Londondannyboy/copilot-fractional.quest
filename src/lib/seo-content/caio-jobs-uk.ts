      answer:
        "Most fractional CAIO roles require 10+ years of technology leadership with 5+ years specifically in AI/ML. A strong technical background (PhD in ML/AI, or MSc with extensive industry experience) combined with business acumen is essential. Experience with modern ML frameworks, cloud AI platforms, and increasingly LLMs/generative AI is expected. Board-level communication skills and strategic planning experience are critical.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional Chief AI Officers earn in the UK?",
      answer:
        "UK fractional CAIOs typically earn £1,000-£1,800 per day, with financial services and PE-backed tech at the premium end (£1,500-£1,800). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £200,000-£400,000 are achievable while building a diverse AI leadership portfolio.",

    {
      question: "Do fractional Chief AI Officers work remotely?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "What's the difference between a CAIO and Head of Data Science?",
      answer:
        "A CAIO has broader strategic responsibility than a Head of Data Science.

A Head of Data Science typically focuses on technical execution and team management within a narrower scope.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find fractional CAIO roles?",
      answer:
        "The most effective approaches are: registering with specialist platforms like Fractional Quest, networking through AI and tech leadership communities (AI UK, Turing Institute events), building relationships with PE firms and VCs who place AI leaders in portfolio companies, and developing a strong LinkedIn presence showcasing AI transformation experience and measurable business outcomes.",
