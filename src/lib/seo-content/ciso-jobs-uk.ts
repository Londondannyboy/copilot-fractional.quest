        "With cyber threats increasing and regulatory requirements tightening, every company needs security leadership. The NCSC reports 2.7 million cyber attacks on UK businesses annually, yet only 14% of businesses have a dedicated security lead. <strong>Fractional CISO jobs</strong> deliver experienced cybersecurity expertise without the £200k+ full-time cost.",
        "The UK Cyber Security Council estimates a gap of 50,000 unfilled security roles, with senior leadership positions being the hardest to fill. (ISC)² research shows that companies with <strong>fractional CISO jobs</strong> achieve 40% faster compliance and 60% better incident response compared to those without dedicated security leadership.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What qualifications do fractional CISOs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CISO roles require CISSP, CISM, or equivalent certifications plus 10-15+ years security experience. Prior CISO or Security Director experience is typically essential. Sector-specific credentials add significant value: CREST for penetration testing, PCI QSA for payments, DSPT Lead Assessor for NHS. Security clearance (SC/DV) opens additional opportunities.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional CISOs earn in the UK?",
      answer:
        "UK fractional CISOs typically earn £1,000-£1,500 per day, with financial services and healthcare at the premium end (£1,200-£1,800). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £200,000-£360,000 are achievable. This often exceeds full-time CISO salaries while offering portfolio variety.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical fractional CISO engagement?",
      answer:
        "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 1-2 days per week commitment. Many companies need less intensive ongoing support once security foundations are established. Compliance projects (ISO 27001, SOC 2) may be more intensive for 3-6 months. Incident response is on-call with surge capacity.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do fractional CISOs work remotely?",
      answer:
        "About 75% of fractional CISO roles offer hybrid or fully remote arrangements. Security leadership is increasingly remote-friendly, though some on-site presence is expected for board meetings, security audits, incident response, and sensitive discussions. Financial services and critical infrastructure roles tend toward more on-site presence.",
    },
    {
      question: "What certifications are most valuable for fractional CISOs?",
      answer:
        "The most valued certifications are: CISSP (considered essential), CISM (governance focus), CREST (for technical credibility), ISO 27001 Lead Implementer/Auditor, and sector-specific credentials like PCI QSA or DSPT Lead Assessor. AWS/Azure security certifications add value for cloud-heavy environments.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I transition to fractional CISO work?",
      answer:
        "The most effective path combines: obtaining and maintaining key certifications (CISSP, CISM), building a professional network through ISACA and (ISC)² chapters, developing case studies of security programmes you've built or improved, speaking at CyberUK or BSides events, and registering with specialist platforms like Fractional Quest. Many CISOs start with advisory work alongside employment before transitioning fully.",
