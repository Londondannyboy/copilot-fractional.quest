      question: "What qualifications do fractional CDOs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CDO roles require 10-15+ years of data experience with prior CDO, VP Data, or Head of Analytics experience. DAMA CDMP certification, cloud data platform expertise (Snowflake, Databricks, AWS), and sector-specific knowledge (financial services, healthcare) are valued.

    },
    {
      question: "How do I transition to fractional CDO work?",
