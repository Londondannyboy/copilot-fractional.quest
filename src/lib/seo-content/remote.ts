      title: "Why Remote Fractional Work is Booming",
      paragraphs: [
        "Remote fractional executive work has transformed the UK job market. Since 2020, companies have discovered that C-suite leadership doesn't require physical presence—it requires expertise, strategic thinking, and results. This shift has created unprecedented opportunities for fractional executives to work with multiple clients from anywhere.",
        "According to CIPD research, 78% of UK organisations now offer some form of flexible working, with remote fractional arrangements becoming the fastest-growing segment. For scale-ups and SMEs outside major cities, remote fractional executives provide access to world-class talent they couldn't otherwise attract.",
        "Remote fractional roles typically command day rates of £800-£1,400, slightly below London rates but with zero commuting costs and greater flexibility. Many executives report earning more annually by taking on additional remote clients they couldn't serve if tied to an office.",

        "Remote fractional work is expected to grow 40% annually through 2028. As companies become more comfortable with distributed leadership, the premium for London-based executives is narrowing—great news for those outside the capital.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Can all fractional executive roles be done remotely?",
      answer: "Most fractional roles can be done 80-100% remotely. CFO, CTO, CISO, and CPO roles are particularly well-suited to remote work. COO and CHRO roles may require more on-site time for team-building, though many are now fully remote.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do remote fractional executives earn less than on-site?",
      answer: "Remote rates are typically 10-15% below London on-site rates, but when you factor in zero commuting costs (£5-12k annually), flexible scheduling allowing more clients, and quality of life improvements, most remote executives report higher overall earnings.",
    },
    {
      question: "What tools do remote fractional executives need?",
      answer: "Essential tools include: video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet), collaboration (Slack, Teams), project management (Notion, Asana), and secure document sharing. Most companies provide access to their tool stack. A reliable internet connection and home office setup are must-haves.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do remote fractional executives build client relationships?",
      answer: "Successful remote executives use regular video check-ins, async communication via Loom videos, quarterly on-site visits, and clear documentation. The key is over-communicating and being more intentional about relationship-building than you would in an office.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are remote fractional roles available outside the UK?",
      answer: "Yes, increasingly. UK companies hire fractional executives across Europe, and US/global companies hire UK-based executives for timezone coverage. However, tax and legal considerations apply—most work under UK IR35 rules regardless of client location.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I transition from on-site to remote fractional work?",
      answer: "Start by taking on one remote client while maintaining local work. Build your remote toolkit and communication skills. Join remote-focused networks like Remote.co and Flexa. Once you have 2-3 remote clients with strong references, you can transition fully.",
    },
