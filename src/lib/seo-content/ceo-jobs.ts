  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What experience do I need to become a fractional CEO?",
      answer:
        "Fractional CEO roles typically require prior CEO, Managing Director, or equivalent experience leading organizations of significant scale (usually £10M+ revenue). Board experience, P&L ownership, and track record of successful outcomes are essential. PE-backed company experience adds significant value.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I earn as a fractional CEO?",
      answer:
        "Fractional CEO day rates typically range from £1,000-£2,000+ in the UK and $2,000-$3,500 in the US. Given the intensity of CEO roles, many fractional CEOs work 3-4 days per week with one primary client, earning £250,000-£450,000+ annually.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find fractional CEO opportunities?",
      answer:
        "The best approaches are: PE and VC networks, executive search firms specializing in interim leadership, IOD and YPO networks, non-executive director networks, and specialist platforms like Fractional Quest. Reputation and referrals are particularly important at CEO level.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can fractional CEO work be done remotely?",
      answer:
        "Approximately 55% of fractional CEO roles are hybrid. CEO leadership typically requires significant on-site presence for board meetings, leadership team engagement, and stakeholder relationships. Fully remote CEO roles are rare and typically limited to early-stage tech companies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical fractional CEO engagement?",
      answer:
        "Engagements typically run 6-18 months with 3-4 days per week commitment. Many are transition-focused (PE acquisition, succession, turnaround) with defined objectives and handoff to permanent leadership. Some evolve into ongoing advisory or board relationships.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is fractional CEO different from interim CEO?",
      answer:
        "The terms overlap significantly. 'Interim CEO' often implies full-time, temporary leadership during a specific transition. 'Fractional CEO' suggests part-time, potentially longer-term engagement across one or more organizations. In practice, many roles blend elements of both.",
    },
