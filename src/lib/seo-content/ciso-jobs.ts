      question: "What certifications do I need to become a fractional CISO?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CISO roles expect CISSP, CISM, or equivalent certification plus 10-15+ years of security experience including leadership roles.

        "Fractional CISO day rates typically range from £900-£1,800 in the UK and $1,500-$2,500 in the US. Working across multiple clients, annual earnings of £200,000-£400,000+ are achievable. Financial services and incident response command premium rates.",

    {
      question: "Can fractional CISO work be done remotely?",
      answer:
        "Approximately 70% of fractional CISO roles are remote or hybrid. Security leadership suits remote work for strategy and governance. Some on-site presence expected for audits, board presentations, and incident response. Regulated sectors may have data residency considerations.",

      question: "What's the typical fractional CISO engagement?",
      answer:
        "Engagements vary widely: compliance projects (3-6 months, intensive), ongoing vCISO retainers (1-2 days/week, 12+ months), or incident response (days to weeks, urgent). Many fractional CISOs maintain 3-5 concurrent clients at different intensities.",

    {
      question: "What's the difference between vCISO and fractional CISO?",
      answer:
        "The terms are often used interchangeably. 'vCISO' (Virtual CISO) typically implies remote-first, ongoing retainer arrangements. 'Fractional CISO' may include more on-site engagement. Both describe part-time, outsourced security leadership rather than full-time employment.",
