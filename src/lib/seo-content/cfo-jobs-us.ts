      question: "What is a fractional CFO?",
      answer:
        "A fractional CFO is an experienced finance leader who works part-time across multiple companies, typically 1-3 days per week. They provide the same strategic finance leadership as a full-time CFO but at a fraction of the cost, making senior finance expertise accessible to startups, SMBs, and PE/VC-backed companies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do fractional CFOs need in the US?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CFO roles require CPA certification or equivalent plus 10-15+ years post-qualification experience. Prior CFO, VP Finance, or Controller experience is typically essential. Sector-specific experience (SaaS metrics for tech, SEC reporting for public company experience) adds significant value.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional CFOs earn in the US?",
      answer:
        "US fractional CFOs typically earn $1,200-$2,000 per day, with VC/PE-backed and pre-IPO roles at the premium end ($1,500-$2,500). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of $250,000-$450,000 are achievable while offering greater flexibility than permanent roles.",

      answer:
        "Yes, approximately 65% of fractional CFO roles are now fully remote. Remote CFO jobs are most common in SaaS, eCommerce, and digital-first businesses. Companies requiring board attendance or investor meetings may need some on-site presence, but many offer fully distributed arrangements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a fractional CFO and an interim CFO?",
      answer:
        "A fractional CFO works part-time (1-3 days/week) on an ongoing basis, often with multiple clients simultaneously. An interim CFO works full-time for a fixed period (3-12 months), usually covering a vacancy or managing a specific project like M&A or IPO preparation. Fractional CFOs cost less annually but are less available day-to-day.",
    },
    {

      answer:
        "VC/PE-backed companies and pre-IPO tech firms pay the highest fractional CFO rates ($1,500-$2,500/day). Series B+ fundraising and M&A-focused roles also command premium rates. SMB and non-profit sectors pay lower rates but often offer more flexibility and purpose-driven work.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find fractional CFO roles in the US?",
      answer:
        "The most effective approaches are: registering with specialist platforms like Fractional Quest, networking through FEI and CFO networks, building relationships with VC/PE firms who frequently place CFOs in portfolio companies, and developing a LinkedIn presence showcasing finance leadership expertise.
