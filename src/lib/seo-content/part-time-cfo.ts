      question: "What does a part-time CFO do?",
      answer:
        "A part-time CFO provides strategic financial leadership on a reduced schedule, typically 1-3 days per week. Responsibilities include financial strategy, board reporting, fundraising support, cash flow management, finance team oversight, and investor relations. They deliver CFO-level expertise without the cost of a full-time hire.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a part-time CFO cost?",
      answer:
        "Part-time CFO day rates in the UK range from £800-£1,800 per day depending on sector and complexity. A typical 2-day per week engagement costs £80,000-£140,000 annually - compared to £150,000-£250,000+ for a full-time CFO package. This represents 50-70% cost savings.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a part-time CFO and fractional CFO?",
      answer:
        "The terms are often used interchangeably. 'Part-time CFO' emphasizes reduced hours on a set schedule, while 'fractional CFO' emphasizes the portfolio nature of working across multiple clients. Both refer to senior finance leaders working less than full-time with ongoing engagements.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should a company hire a part-time CFO?",
      answer:
        "Companies should consider a part-time CFO when they need strategic finance leadership but don't require or can't afford a full-time CFO. Common triggers include: preparing for fundraising, needing board-level financial oversight, building finance systems, or professionalising financial operations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do part-time CFOs have?",
      answer:
        "Most part-time CFOs are ACA, ACCA, or CIMA qualified with 10-15+ years post-qualification experience. Prior CFO, Finance Director, or senior FP&A experience is typically required. Sector expertise (PE, FCA, SaaS) adds significant value and commands premium rates.",
    },
    {
      question: "How many clients do part-time CFOs typically work with?",
      answer:
        "Most part-time CFOs work with 2-4 clients simultaneously, totalling 6-10 days per month. This portfolio approach provides variety and income stability. Some work with just one client part-time alongside other activities like NED roles or consulting.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I hire a part-time CFO remotely?",
      answer:
        "Yes, around 30% of part-time CFO roles are fully remote, with 70% offering hybrid arrangements. Remote works well for SaaS, eCommerce, and consulting sectors. Regulated sectors and PE-backed companies often require some on-site presence for board meetings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find part-time CFO jobs?",
      answer:
        "The most effective approaches are: specialist platforms like Fractional Quest, networking through ICAEW/ACCA, building PE firm relationships, LinkedIn presence, and executive recruitment agencies. Search for 'part-time CFO jobs', 'fractional CFO', or 'part-time finance director' to find opportunities.",
