  faqs: [
    { question: "How much does a fractional Managing Director cost in the UK?", answer: "A fractional Managing Director in the UK typically costs £4,500-£10,000 per month or £950-£1,600 per day, depending on company situation and complexity. According to Pitch Hill Partners and IoD (Jan 2026): Growth/scale-up MDs charge £1,000-£1,400/day, turnaround MDs charge £1,100-£1,600/day, PE portfolio MDs charge £1,200-£1,800/day, and post-acquisition integration specialists command £1,200-£1,700/day. Most work 4-day weeks. This represents 40-64% savings compared to a full-time MD hire (£150,000-£250,000 annually including benefits)." },
    { question: "What's the difference between an MD and CEO?", answer: "In UK usage, a Managing Director typically has hands-on operational responsibility for running a business, while a CEO may have a more strategic, investor-facing role. In many SMEs, these titles are used interchangeably. MDs often report to a board or PE sponsor, while CEOs typically have more autonomy. Fractional MD rates are similar to CEO rates (£1,000-£1,800/day)." },
    { question: "How much do fractional Managing Directors earn?", answer: "UK fractional MDs typically earn £950-£1,600 per day, with PE-backed, turnaround and post-acquisition roles at the premium end (£1,200-£1,800). Working 3-4 days per week, annual earnings of £190,000-£360,000 are achievable while offering variety across different business challenges." },
    { question: "What qualifications do fractional MDs need?", answer: "Most fractional MD roles require 15-20+ years business experience with prior MD, CEO, or senior GM experience. IoD membership, MBA, and sector expertise add value. PE-backed roles often require previous PE portfolio company experience. Track record in turnarounds, scaling, or integrations is highly valued." },
    { question: "What's the typical fractional MD engagement?", answer: "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 3-4 days per week commitment. Turnaround projects may be more intensive (4-5 days). Many engagements are project-based with clear milestones: turnaround, integration, scaling to exit. Some evolve into longer-term operational leadership." },
