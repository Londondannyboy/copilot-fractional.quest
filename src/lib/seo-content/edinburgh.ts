        "Edinburgh fractional executives typically command £700-£1,200 per day, around 10-20% below London rates. The financial services sector (CFOs, finance leaders) commands the highest rates, often matching or exceeding some London roles due to specialised demand.",

    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications are valued in Edinburgh?",
      answer:
        "Scottish CA qualification is highly valued for finance roles. For tech roles, Edinburgh's university links (Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt) mean academic credentials are respected. Prior experience in asset management or fintech is particularly valuable.",

    {
      question: "Are Edinburgh roles hybrid or on-site?",
      answer:
        "Around 60% of Edinburgh fractional roles offer hybrid arrangements. The financial services sector tends toward more on-site presence, while tech companies are generally more flexible. Most roles expect at least 1-2 days per week in-person.",
