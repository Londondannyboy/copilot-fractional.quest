According to McKinsey and IoD (Jan 2026): SME/corporate strategy CSOs charge £800-£1,200/day, digital transformation CSOs charge £1,100-£1,600/day, M&A/PE-backed CSOs charge £1,200-£1,800/day, and exit strategy/IPO specialists command £1,500-£1,900/day.

    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do fractional CSOs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CSO roles require 15+ years of strategy experience including prior CSO, Strategy Director, or senior consulting experience at firms like McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. MBA from a top business school (LBS, INSEAD, Harvard) is common but not essential. Sector expertise and track record of successful strategy execution matter more than credentials.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional CSOs earn in the UK?",
      answer:
        "UK fractional CSOs typically earn £900-£1,500 per day, with PE-backed and M&A-focused roles at the premium end (£1,200-£1,600). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £180,000-£320,000 are achievable while maintaining the strategic variety that many CSOs seek.",

    {
      question: "What's the typical fractional CSO engagement?",
      answer:
        "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 2-3 days per week commitment. Many CSOs are brought in for specific strategic initiatives: M&A integration, market entry, transformation programmes. Some evolve into ongoing strategic advisory roles with reduced time commitment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do fractional CSOs work remotely?",
      answer:
        "About 70% of fractional CSO roles offer hybrid arrangements. Strategy work benefits from in-person workshops for ideation and alignment, but much analysis and planning can be done remotely. Board presentations and executive team sessions typically require on-site presence.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a fractional CSO and a strategy consultant?",
      answer:
        "A fractional CSO is embedded in the organisation, accountable for strategy execution, and typically involved in implementation. Strategy consultants provide external advice on specific projects. Fractional CSOs build internal capability and own outcomes; consultants deliver recommendations and move on.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find fractional CSO roles?",
      answer:
        "The most effective approaches are: registering with specialist platforms like Fractional Quest, maintaining relationships with PE firms and corporate development teams, networking through IOD and strategy professional networks, and building a LinkedIn presence showcasing strategic impact and transformation case studies.",
