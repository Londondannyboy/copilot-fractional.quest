        "The fractional FD (Finance Director) model has become mainstream across UK SMEs. According to ICAEW research, 65% of growing businesses with £1M-£10M turnover now use some form of part-time finance leadership. The term 'FD' is preferred in the UK over the American 'CFO' for many SME contexts.",

        "ICAEW forecasts continued strong demand for fractional FDs through 2028, driven by the ongoing skills shortage in senior finance roles, increasing adoption of part-time executive models in SMEs, and the normalisation of portfolio careers among qualified accountants.",

      question: "What is the difference between an FD and a CFO?",
      answer:
        "In the UK, 'Finance Director' (FD) and 'Chief Financial Officer' (CFO) are often used interchangeably, but FD is more common in SMEs and mid-market companies, while CFO is typically used in larger corporates and PE-backed businesses. Functionally, both roles provide strategic financial leadership, but CFO titles often carry additional strategic and investor relations responsibilities.",
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do fractional FDs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional FD roles require ACA, ACCA, or CIMA qualification plus 10-15+ years post-qualification experience. Prior FD, Financial Controller, or Group Accountant experience is typically essential. Sector-specific experience and industry knowledge add significant value.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional FDs earn in the UK?",
      answer:
        "UK fractional FDs typically earn £800-£1,400 per day, with PE-backed and larger turnover companies at the premium end. Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £150,000-£280,000 are achievable while offering greater flexibility than permanent roles.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical fractional FD engagement?",
      answer:
        "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 2-3 days per week commitment. Many SMEs prefer ongoing relationships with their FD for continuity. Some FDs maintain 2-3 concurrent clients for portfolio diversity.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do fractional FDs work remotely?",
      answer:
        "About 75% of fractional FD roles offer hybrid arrangements. SMEs often require some on-site presence for team management, bank meetings, and board presentations, but most admin and analysis work can be done remotely.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find fractional FD roles?",
      answer:
        "The most effective approaches are: registering with specialist platforms like Fractional Quest, networking through ICAEW/ACCA events and FD networks, building relationships with accountancy firms who refer FD work, and developing a LinkedIn presence showcasing finance leadership expertise.",
