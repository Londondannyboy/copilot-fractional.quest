    {
      question: "How much does a fractional Finance Director cost in the UK?",
      answer: "A fractional Finance Director in the UK typically costs £1,500-£5,000 per month or £600-£1,100 per day, depending on company size and complexity. According to FD Capital and EmergeOne (Jan 2026): SME/owner-managed FDs charge £600-£850/day, scale-up FDs (£5m-£50m revenue) charge £800-£1,100/day, and PE-backed/M&A specialists command £950-£1,300/day. Turnaround FDs typically charge £850-£1,200/day. This represents 58-74% savings compared to a full-time FD hire (£85,000-£140,000 annually including benefits).",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a Finance Director and CFO?",
      answer: "A Finance Director (FD) typically focuses on operational finance: management accounts, financial controls, compliance, and treasury. A CFO has a more strategic focus: fundraising, investor relations, M&A, and board-level reporting. In the UK, FD is more common for SMEs while CFO is typically used for larger or investor-backed companies. FD day rates are typically 10-15% lower than CFO rates.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much do fractional Finance Directors earn?",
      answer: "UK fractional FDs typically earn £600-£1,100 per day, with PE-backed and turnaround roles at the premium end (£950-£1,300). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £120,000-£260,000 are achievable while offering greater variety than permanent roles.",
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifications do fractional FDs need?",
      answer: "Most fractional FD roles require ACA, ACCA, or CIMA qualification plus 10-15+ years finance experience. Prior FD, FC, or senior finance manager experience is typically essential. Sector expertise (manufacturing, SaaS, professional services) adds significant value. Experience with specific ERP systems (Sage, Xero, NetSuite) is often required.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical fractional FD engagement?",
      answer: "Initial engagements typically run 6-12 months with 1-2 days per week commitment. SMEs often need more intensive support during year-end, audit periods, or system implementations. Many relationships become long-term as companies value financial continuity and institutional knowledge.",
