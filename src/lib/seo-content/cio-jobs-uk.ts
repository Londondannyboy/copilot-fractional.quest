      question: "What qualifications do fractional CIOs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CIO roles require 15+ years of IT leadership experience with prior CIO, IT Director, or VP IT experience. BCS Chartered IT Professional status, ITIL certification, and relevant vendor certifications (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) add credibility. Track record of successful transformation programmes and business impact is essential.",

        "UK fractional CIOs typically earn £1,000-£1,500 per day, with financial services and large-scale transformation roles at the premium end (£1,200-£1,800). Working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients, annual earnings of £200,000-£360,000 are achievable while maintaining the variety that many technology leaders seek.",

      answer:
        "Initial engagements typically run 6-18 months with 2-3 days per week commitment. Many CIOs are brought in for specific initiatives: cloud migration, technology strategy development, or post-merger IT integration. vCIO arrangements for SMEs may be lighter (1 day per week) but longer-term.",

      question: "Do fractional CIOs work remotely?",
      answer:
        "About 65% of fractional CIO roles offer hybrid arrangements. IT leadership benefits from in-person time for team leadership, vendor negotiations, and board presentations, but much strategic work can be done remotely. Infrastructure and security roles tend toward more on-site presence.",

      question: "What's the difference between a CIO and a CTO?",
      answer:
        "A CIO typically focuses on internal IT operations, enterprise systems, and business technology enablement.
