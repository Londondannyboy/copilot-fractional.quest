      question: "What qualifications do fractional CIOs need?",
      answer:
        "Most fractional CIO roles require 15+ years of IT leadership experience with prior CIO, IT Director, or VP IT experience. BCS Chartered IT Professional status, ITIL certification, and relevant vendor certifications (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) add credibility. Track record of successful transformation programmes and business impact is essential.",
