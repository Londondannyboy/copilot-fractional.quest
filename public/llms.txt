## About Fractional Quest

Fractional Quest helps UK businesses find experienced executives for part-time, interim, and advisory engagements. Our platform serves:

## Core Concepts

### What is a Fractional Executive?
A fractional executive is a senior leader who works part-time across multiple companies, typically 1-3 days per week. They provide C-suite expertise at a fraction of full-time cost (typically 50-70% savings).

### What is an Interim Executive?
An interim executive works full-time for a fixed period (typically 3-12 months), providing temporary leadership during transitions, transformations, or while hiring a permanent replacement.

### Engagement Types
- **Fractional**: 1-3 days/week, ongoing relationship
- **Interim**: Full-time, 3-12 months, specific mandate
- **Part-Time**: Fixed days per week, flexible arrangement
- **Advisory**: Board-level guidance, few days per month

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between fractional and interim?
Fractional executives work part-time (1-3 days/week) on an ongoing basis across multiple clients. Interim executives work full-time for a fixed period (3-12 months) with one company, typically during transitions.

### How much does a fractional executive cost?
Fractional executives typically charge £800-1,600 per day depending on role and seniority. For 1-2 days per week, expect £3,200-12,800 monthly—50-70% less than a full-time equivalent.

### When should I hire a fractional vs full-time executive?
Hire fractional when: you need senior expertise but can't justify full-time cost, you're between stages of growth, or you need specific skills for a defined period. Hire full-time when: you need daily hands-on leadership, the role is central to your strategy, or you're at scale.

### What industries use fractional executives?
Technology/SaaS, professional services, e-commerce, healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing are the most common. Any scaling business can benefit from fractional leadership.
